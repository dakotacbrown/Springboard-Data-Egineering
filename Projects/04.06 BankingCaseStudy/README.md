# Banking System Case Study

This project creates a simpler version of a banking system.
Designed using OOP techniques in python, the banking model includes entities
for customers, accounts, and services such as loans or credit cards.

Customers are instantiated based on their account type, checking or savings.
Customers can also have a loan, or credit card.
Customer information is parsed from and saved to json files.

Classes are saved in the banking directory and the json files
within the data directory.

Program can be ran in the command line using the main file in the banking directory.
